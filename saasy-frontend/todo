(also ../todo)

- add market tags to project seed generation

*** PITCH - (pitches & downloads) -- create & pivot off pitch records with file uploads, instead of "project files"
  - add "needs" onto pitches -- needs review, assistance, etc
  - don't include path in file download data (security through obscurity)
    (download path comes after click & then are redirected)
    (consider tying stage+pitch together)

*** COMMENTS - comments on projects/pitches
  - etc are all done reddit style with up/down voting
  - mark post type: constrictive, observation, etc.  As you post gamification kicks in (but not on just ranking)
    - receiver can ack back -- marking that they felt the feedback was helpful (or not)
  - Feedback/comments & posts (post on projects, comment/feedback on posts)
  - post updates to project (press releases, etc)--appear on feed

*** RANKING rankings, karma, etc
   - figure out universal +/- that can be pinned to many things

*** PROFILE
  - results list -- not past work, but past results / outcomes
  - shift so skills is the same lookup table for both what I'm good at and what I'm learning
  - Set unique index on user_tags  type+label
  - have tag insertion do a replace_into

*** PROJECT
  - market - tags from DB (migrate profile_tags to tags?)
  - updates/discussion (posts on project)
  - member locations mapped to project:  Utah(1), California(3) etc

  - corporate sponsor links per project
  - what we did/doing/next
~ - improvements to search results page -- table/tile option?
  - find similar companies/products and link << or in journey sufficient >>

*** FEED - future "feed" as home - it's the default.  Includes a blend of updated projects, etc.
  - nav links: {home is feed}, {about}  {events?}  {studio? -- self}

  - feed includes:
    - update posts associated with a project
    - projects as they are updated (or trending)
    - pitches as posted on projects
    - ad-hoc posts?  Don't know.... best if tied to project


*** smart city challenge - home-AI which can control access to your home, safely, easily, and securely

*** random thoughts / possible things

  - possibly: tile-like view for feed where 1x1 is free and if you want you can
    pay to have yours 1x2 or 2x2

  - on question: don't show completed checkbox until at least one word is in box
    (eventually) show links to discussions

  - home-page snapshots of app functionality (no need for demo projects then)
    - videos maybe too

  - user admin b0rk

  - follow, like, etc
  - corporate type entities/signins/members - link to corporate profile instead of member
  - "If you aren't listed, your missing out."
  - change user/project address -> location
  - `store/` resolver changes for user to punt through profile resolver ?
  - cannot leave project by yourself -- must ask admin (fix this later)
  - <NotSignedIn/> - put in examples & link back to home content showing what's avialbale there
